# REST node for a walking distance acummulator service

The walking distance programm lets a user select routes he wants to walk and then add distances walked daily. The program then shows the currently walked distance and the overall progress. 

This is the REST service that is used to send data to and return data to clients. The layout is far from finished, as this is 0.x release and will be changed in various ways.
