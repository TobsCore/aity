# REST node for a aitying distance acummulator service

The aitying distance programm lets a user select routes he wants to aity and then add distances aityed daily. The program then shows the currently aityed distance and the overall progress. 

This is the REST service that is used to send data to and return data to clients. The layout is far from finished, as this is 0.x release and will be changed in various ways.
